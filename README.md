# Scrobble
## A Scrabble-like game with Meteor

A simple scrabble-like game implementd with Meteor. Name has to change.

## How to run

1. `npm install -g meteorite` (if not already installed)
2. `mrt`

should do the trick. The first start is quite slow as it needs the dictionary in the database.

## Demo

A live demo is available on [http://scrobble.meteor.com]
